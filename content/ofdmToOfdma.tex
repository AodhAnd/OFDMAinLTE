\chapter{From OFDM to OFDMA}
To be able to transmit a lot of data to many users, the physical resources, i.e. space, time and electromagnetic (frequency) spectrum, need to be used and shared in an optimal way.\\

\section{Introduction to Modern Mobile Communications}
When talking about mobile communications, the space  resource is usually managed by using fixed base stations (BS) placed in a certain pattern similar to bee-hive cells. These BS are placed so that they can deliver information wirelessly to mobile stations within the range of their cell or seemlessly moving from a cell to another.\\

To achieve high data rates and multiple user services within a cell, it is however necessary to design techniques making smart use of time and frequency resources. ODFM is one of these techniques and is being used in several applications both in cable and wireless network such as ADSL, VDSL or WLAN and 4G LTE.
